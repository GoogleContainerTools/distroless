# Documentation for `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs`

## Image Contents

These images contain a minimal Linux, Node.js-based runtime. The supported versions match the [Node.js LTS releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

Specifically, these images contain everything in the [base image](../base/README.md), plus one of:

- Node.js v10 (`gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:10`) and its dependencies.
- Node.js v12 (`gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:12`) and its dependencies.
- Node.js v14 (`gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:14`) and its dependencies.

**Note:** the `latest` tag maps to Node.js v14 to follow the official node docker images. However we recommend that users of these images should explicitly set the LTS version tag they wish to use.

## Usage

The entrypoint of this image is set to "node", so this image expects users to supply a path to a .js file in the CMD.

See the Node.js [Hello World](../examples/nodejs/) directory for an example.
