- [ ] I have read the [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
- [ ] I understand that this repo tracks debian package releases and cannot fix debian CVEs on its own
- [ ] this CVE shows a fix is available in the appropriate debian version (buster, bullseye) and channel (main, security) *and* it has been more than 48 hours.

Please describe the image you encountered this with and a link to the debian security tracker
